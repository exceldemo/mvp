# Exercise

Imagine you are developing an add-in that needs to create, update and remove custom document properties. For this exercise you will want to write code that:

1. Using the sample in the [Walkthrough](walkthrough.md) Add a custom document property, give it any name and value you like. When you click the Run button have it confirm that it is done via console.log(). Now go to File, Info, click Properties and select Advanced Proeprties, click Custom and verify the value is added.
2. Replace the code in Script Lab now, with code tht updates the custom document property with any value you like. When you click the Run button have it confirm that it is done via console.log(). Now go to File, Info, click Properties and select Advanced Proeprties, click Custom and verify the value is updated.
3. Replace the code in Script Labe which will remove the custom document property and when you click the Run button it confirm that it is done via console.log(). Go to File, Info, click Properties and select Advanced Proeprties, click Custom and verify it is now gone.
