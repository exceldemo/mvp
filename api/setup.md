# Setup

Follow the steps below to try out the APIs yourself. If you want to try the custom functions preview, separate setup steps apply - see [Custom Functions Setup](../misc/setup-custom-functions.md).

## Excel desktop application
Ensure you have an O365 monthly build of Excel installed on your laptop. Any recent build is sufficient (no need for Dogfood build).

## Install Script Lab add-in
Script Lab is a fantastic tool and a playground for office Add-ins. Thsi tool will allow us to share the new programming models with you without having to leave the application to do it. All the samples shown in the hands-on section would require you to try them in Script Lab.

Script Lab can be installed two easy ways.
### 1 Via Add-ins Within Excel
With-in your Office Application navigate to the Insert Tab on the Ribbon. Once there, there should be a Add-ins Group and an Add-ins Button. Select the button dropdown and click on My Add-ins. 
Once you select My Add-ins , Navigate to the Store tab and search for 'Script Lab'. Install Script Lab.
